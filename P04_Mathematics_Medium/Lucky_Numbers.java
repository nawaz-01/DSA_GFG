// A lucky number is defined using a special elimination process:
//    1. Start with natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...
//    2. In the 1st step, remove every 2nd number.
//    3. In the 2nd step, remove every 3rd remaining number.
//    4. In the 3rd step, remove every 4th remaining number, and so on...
// This continues indefinitely. Given an integer n, determine if it remains after all steps.
// Return 1 if n is a lucky number, otherwise return 0.

// The solution involves simulating the elimination process and checking if n survives.
// The code is not provided, but the logic can be implemented using a loop to simulate the elimination process.
