// Given a positive integer n, The task is to find the value of Î£i F(i) where i is from 1 to n and function F(i) is defined as the sum of all divisors of i.

// Example: If n = 5, the output should be 15 (F(1) + F(2) + F(3) + F(4) + F(5) = 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 6 = 21).
// If n is 0, the output should be 0.
// Constraints: 0 <= n <= 10^5
// Time Complexity: O(n^2) for the naive approach, which is inefficient for large n.
// Space Complexity: O(1) for the naive approach, as we are not using any
// additional data structures.
// For an efficient solution, consider using a sieve-like approach to calculate the sum of divisors for all numbers up to n in O(n log n) time.
// Note: The naive approach is not efficient for large n due to the quadratic time complexity.
