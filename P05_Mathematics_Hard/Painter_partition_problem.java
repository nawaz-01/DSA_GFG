// Dilpreet wants to paint his dog's home that has n boards with different lengths. The length of ith board is given by arr[i] where arr[] is an array of n integers. He hired k painters for this work and each painter takes 1 unit time to paint 1 unit of the board.

// Return the minimum time to get this job done if all painters start together with the constraint that any painter will only paint continuous boards, say boards numbered [2,3,4] or only board [1] or nothing but not boards [2,4,5].

// Time Complexity: O(n * log(sum(arr)))
// Space Complexity: O(1)
// where n is the number of boards and sum(arr) is the sum of lengths of all
// boards.
// The algorithm uses binary search to find the minimum time required to paint
// all boards while ensuring that no painter exceeds the maximum allowed time.
// The isPossible function checks if it is feasible to paint the boards with the
// given constraints.
// The solution efficiently partitions the boards among the painters while
// adhering to the constraints of continuous painting and maximum time limits.
// The binary search approach ensures that we find the optimal solution in
// logarithmic time relative to the total length of the boards, making it
// efficient for larger inputs.
// The solution is designed to handle edge cases, such as when there are fewer
// painters than boards or when the lengths of the boards vary significantly.
// The algorithm is robust and can handle various scenarios, ensuring that the
// minimum time is calculated accurately while adhering to the constraints
// provided in the problem statement.
// The solution is implemented in Java and can be easily integrated into larger
// systems or used as a standalone utility for solving similar partition
// problems.
// The code is structured to be clear and maintainable, with separate methods
// for the main logic and the feasibility check, making it easy to understand
// and modify if necessary.
// The solution is efficient and adheres to the constraints of the problem,
// ensuring that it meets the requirements for optimal performance in
// competitive programming scenarios.
// The implementation is straightforward, using a binary search approach to
// minimize the maximum time taken by any painter while ensuring that all boards
// are painted within the constraints given.
// The solution is designed to be efficient and effective, providing a clear
// path to solving the painter partition problem with minimal time complexity
// and optimal resource utilization.
// The code is ready for use in competitive programming or as part of a larger
// project, providing a reliable solution to the painter partition problem with
// clear logic and efficient execution.
